# Activity

Hi. I'm Steve. I have been working as a financial statment and regulatory form preparer for Citco for the past 3 years after graduating from the University of Minnesota Duluth with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science.

My goals in this program is to further my understanding of current and emerging technologies to prepare me as the finance industry adopts more technology. It is my goal to seek a new job manipulating data using skills I've learned in this program.

I chose FinTech as a career path since I have career experience in finance and belive I can use that and my skills with math and computer science to push myself further.
